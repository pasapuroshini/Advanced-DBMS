1.  **User/Application:**
    
    *   Users or applications send **queries and updates** to the DBMS.
        
2.  **Query Compiler:**
    
    *   It **parses** and **optimizes** queries and generates a **query execution plan**.
        
3.  **Transaction Manager:**
    
    *   Manages **transaction execution** ensuring **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
        
    *   It works with the **Logging and Recovery** and **Concurrency Control** modules.
        
4.  **DDL Compiler:**
    
    *   Used by **Database Administrators** to process **Data Definition Language (DDL) commands** (like CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
        
    *   It generates **metadata** for database schema definitions.
        
5.  **Execution Engine:**
    
    *   It executes **query plans** received from the Query Compiler.
        
    *   Communicates with **Index/File/Record Manager** for data retrieval.
        
6.  **Logging and Recovery:**
    
    *   Maintains **log pages** for transactions.
        
    *   Ensures database recovery in case of failure.
        
7.  **Concurrency Control:**
    
    *   Ensures **consistent access** to the database by multiple users.
        
    *   Uses a **Lock Table** to handle concurrent transactions.
        
8.  **Index/File/Record Manager:**
    
    *   Handles **indexing**, **file storage**, and **record management**.
        
    *   Receives requests from the **Execution Engine**.
        
9.  **Buffer Manager:**
    
    *   Manages **data pages** in memory (buffers) for faster access.
        
    *   Works with **Storage Manager** to read/write data efficiently.
        
10.  **Storage Manager:**
    
    *   Handles **physical storage** of data in **disk storage**.
        

### **Flow of Operations:**

*   Users send queries → **Query Compiler** processes them → **Execution Engine** executes them with the help of **Transaction Manager**, **Index/File Manager**, and **Buffer Manager**.
    
*   **Logging and Recovery** ensures data safety.
    
*   **Concurrency Control** ensures smooth multi-user transactions.
    
*   Data is stored and retrieved efficiently through **Storage Manager**.
    

This architecture ensures efficient **query processing, transaction management, concurrency control, and data storage** in a database system.
