### **1\. Query Parsing**

*   The query issued by the user (e.g., SELECT \* FROM students WHERE age > 20;) is first sent to the **Query Compiler**.
    
*   The **Query Compiler** checks for **syntactic correctness** and **semantic meaning**.
    
*   If valid, it generates a **query plan**, which is an optimized sequence of actions needed to execute the query.
    

### **2\. Query Plan Generation**

*   The **Query Compiler** generates an **execution plan**, which includes:
    
    *   **Relational Algebra Expression** (logical plan)
        
    *   **Optimization Strategies** (to minimize execution time)
        
    *   **Physical Query Plan** (step-by-step execution sequence)
        

### **3\. Execution Engine Processing**

*   The **Execution Engine** takes the optimized query plan and starts execution.
    
*   It interacts with the **Resource Manager** (or **Buffer Manager**) to fetch required data.
    
*   Instead of retrieving the entire dataset, it **fetches small portions of data (tuples of a relation)** for efficient processing.
    

### **4\. Data Translation and Buffer Management**

*   The **Resource Manager (Buffer Manager)** converts **logical requests into physical page requests**.
    
*   The requested data is stored in memory buffers for faster access instead of directly fetching from disk every time.
    

### **5\. Data Retrieval from Secondary Storage**

*   If the required data is **not in the buffer**, the **Buffer Manager** fetches it from **secondary storage (database disk)**.
    
*   Data is **loaded into memory pages** to speed up query execution.
    
*   The retrieved data is then **returned to the Execution Engine**, which processes and formats it as per the query request.
    

### **Final Output**

*   The processed data is **returned to the user** as the final query result.
    

### **Key Components in Query Processing:**

1.  **Query Compiler** → Parses and optimizes the query.
    
2.  **Query Plan** → Defines the step-by-step execution of the query.
    
3.  **Execution Engine** → Executes the plan by fetching tuples.
    
4.  **Resource Manager (Buffer Manager)** → Manages memory pages efficiently.
    
5.  **Storage (Secondary Memory)** → Stores the actual database.
    

This process ensures that queries are executed **efficiently** while **minimizing computation and disk access**.
